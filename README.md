# Loan Eligibility Prediction
The Loan Eligibility Prediction System is a machine learning–based solution designed to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process. The project uses applicant data such as income, employment status, loan amount,, and other financial factors to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to be eligible for approval.
# Project Objectives
- To predict loan eligibility based on customer details using machine learning algorithms.
- To reduce manual effort and increase accuracy in loan decision-making.
- To provide data insights into factors influencing loan approvals and rejections.
- To develop an interactive dashboard for visualization and performance monitoring.
  # Workflow & Methodology
- Data Collection
- Gathered historical loan application data containing applicant details (gender, income, loan amount, credit history, etc.).
- Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, education, marital status).
- Normalized numerical features like income and loan amount.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed relationships between variables and loan status.
- Visualized key patterns (e.g., income vs. loan approval, credit score vs. approval rate).
- Model Development
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Applied various ML models to predict loan eligibility.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
- Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
- Prediction & Visualization
# Key Insights
Applicants with good credit history had the highest approval rate.
Loan amount and applicant income strongly influenced eligibility.
Married applicants and those with stable employment were more likely to be approved.
# Results
Achieved ~85–90% prediction accuracy using Random Forest Classifier.
Reduced manual processing time by 40%.
Provided clear, interpretable insights into loan eligibility factors.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance decision-making in the finance sector by improving accuracy, efficiency, and fairness in loan approval systems. It’s a scalable model that can be integrated into banking workflows to automate risk assessment and applicant screening.
